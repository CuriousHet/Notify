# üöÄ Notify - Distributed Notification Delivery Service (Go + gRPC + GraphQL + Prometheus)

This project simulates a **miniature version of how social media platforms (like Instagram or Twitter)** notify users when someone they follow creates a new post.

It uses:

- ‚úÖ **gRPC** to simulate users publishing posts.
- ‚úÖ **Background worker queue** to dispatch notifications.
- ‚úÖ **Retry logic** for failed deliveries.
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL API** to fetch a user‚Äôs notifications.
- ‚úÖ **Prometheus metrics** to monitor performance and failures.

## üì¶ Project Features Overview

| Feature                        | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| gRPC API                      | Simulates publishing a post (`PublishPost`) |
| Notification Queue            | In-memory delivery queue for notifications |
| Worker Pool                   | Concurrent workers simulate delivery |
| Retry Logic                   | Retry 3 times for failed notifications (10% simulated failures) |
| GraphQL API                   | Fetch recent notifications for a user |
| Prometheus Metrics            | Monitor sent, failed notifications, and delivery times |
| In-Memory Store               | All data (posts, followers, notifications) is stored temporarily in Go maps |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Start the System

```bash
make run
```

- gRPC Server ‚Üí `localhost:5050`
- GraphQL Server ‚Üí `localhost:8081`
- Prometheus Metrics ‚Üí `localhost:8081/metrics`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Publish a Post (via gRPC)

Simulate post creation by a user:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"postId":"p1","authorId":"user1","content":"Hello world!"}' localhost:5050 post.PostService/PublishPost
```

üîÑ What happens behind the scenes:

- Finds all followers of `user1` (from mock data).
- Creates a notification for each follower.
- Queues those notifications.
- Background workers pick from the queue and deliver them.
- Logs are printed to the terminal:

  ```
  ‚úÖ Notification sent to user2 for post p1
  ```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Query Notifications (via GraphQL)

Use **Postman**, **Altair**, or a GraphQL client.

URL:  
```
http://localhost:8081/query
```

GraphQL query:
```graphql
{
  notifications(userId: "user2")
}
```

‚úÖ Output:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "notifications": ["New post from user1: Hello world!"]
  }
}
```

---

### üìä Step 4: Monitor with Prometheus

Visit:
```
http://localhost:8081/metrics
```

Key Metrics:

- `notifications_sent_total`: Total successful notifications
- `notifications_failed_total`: Failed notifications
- `notification_delivery_duration_seconds`: Delivery time (histogram)

Sample:
```
# HELP notifications_sent_total Total number of notifications successfully sent
notifications_sent_total 2

# HELP notifications_failed_total Total number of notifications that failed to send
notifications_failed_total 0

# HELP notification_delivery_duration_seconds Duration of notification deliveries
notification_delivery_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 2
notification_delivery_duration_seconds_sum 0.01
notification_delivery_duration_seconds_count 2
```

## üß∞ Under the Hood ‚Äì Explained Simply

### üü£ gRPC (PublishPost)

This simulates a user posting content:

```protobuf
rpc PublishPost(Post) returns (NotificationResponse);
```

It returns the number of notifications queued for delivery.

---

### üîÅ Queue + Dispatcher (Notification Engine)

- New notifications are added to a **Go channel (queue)**.
- A pool of **goroutines (workers)** process the queue.
- Each worker "sends" the notification (just logs it).
- If it fails (simulated 10% failure rate), it:
  - Retries up to 3 times
  - Waits longer each time (exponential backoff)

---

### üß† In-Memory Store

We simulate databases using maps in Go:

```go
// Map: user ‚Üí their followers
map[string][]string

// Map: user ‚Üí their notifications
map[string][]Notification
```

---

### üìà Metrics via Prometheus

Track important health signals:

| Metric                        | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `notifications_sent_total`   | # sent |
| `notifications_failed_total` | # failed |
| `notification_delivery_duration_seconds` | Delivery speed |

Use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) + [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to visualize this later!
